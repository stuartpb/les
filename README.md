# les

Les is a shell script that switches between `ls` and `less` depending on whether its contents are a file or a directory (or a symlink).

## Alternatives

Instead of using this, you can do better by installing a preprocessor for less that handles directories like [lesspipe][] and setting that as your `LESSOPEN`.
